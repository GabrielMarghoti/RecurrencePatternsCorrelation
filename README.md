# Recurrence Patterns Correlation (RPC)

**Recurrence Patterns Correlation (RPC)** is a novel analysis method for uncovering underlying structures within Recurrence Plots (RPs). This repository introduces a new measure for analyzing recurrence patterns by applying **Moran's I**, a spatial autocorrelation metric, to binary 2D grid plots derived from time series data.

## Overview

Recurrence Plots (RPs) are a powerful tool for visualizing and analyzing the dynamics of time series. The RPC method enhances the interpretability of these plots by quantifying spatial correlation within the RP structure.

By leveraging **Moran's I**, this approach provides a quantitative measure of the spatial dependencies present in recurrence patterns—offering deeper insight into the temporal structure and complexity of the original time series.

## Key Features

* ✅ Applies **Moran’s I** to binary recurrence plots
* 📊 Quantifies spatial correlation in 2D time series representations
* 🔍 Enhances analysis of dynamic systems through use defined structural insights

## Use Cases

* Time series structure analysis
* Nonlinear dynamical system exploration
* Complexity and periodicity detection in data
